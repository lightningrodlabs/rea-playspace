# @holochain-open-dev/hrea-modeler

Frontend module for the Holochain zome `hc_zome_hrea_modelers`.

This package includes types, a service and a store, and a collection of Custom Elements to build Holochain applications that automatically connect and interact with the `hc_zome_hrea_modelers` zome. 

By using [Custom Elements](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements), this package exports frontend blocks reusable in any framework, that make it really easy for consuming web applications to include functionality to create and update hrea-modeler, or search for an agent in the DHT.

Read about how to include both the zome and this frontend module in your application here:
