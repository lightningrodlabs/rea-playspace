# rea-playspace
Holochain app to play with REA accounting.

## Status
Active development, POC.

##  Developers

The backend is a bundled [Holo-REA](https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea) running in the [Holochain Launcher v0.3.9](https://github.com/holochain/launcher). 

[Follow these steps](https://github.com/Connoropolous/holo-rea/releases/tag/0.0.22-alpha) to setup a development backend. The HackMD article in the previous link provided an excellent intro to launching Holo-REA, exploring the GraphQL API using the bundled GraphIQL web app as well as a primer to the [Valueflows](https://www.valueflo.ws/) vocabulary.

This project was scaffolded using the [RAD create tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain-open-dev/create) which follows the patterns from [Holochain Open Dev](https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/).

To connect the [Holochain Playground](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain-playground/cli) to the running hrea.webhapp, run

```
npx @holochain-playground/cli ws://localhost:<admin port>
```
where `<admin port>` can be found in the holochain launcher.log and looks like

```
INFO - [UI] Connected to Holochain, Admin port = 15077, App URL = ws://localhost:15358/
```
## UI Design Ideas
[Resource Flow Diagrams](https://write.as/economic-networks/visual-languages-resource-flow-diagrams). Each [process](https://www.valueflo.ws/concepts/processes/) should be configurable to have multiple inputs and outputs, each which represents [economicResources](https://www.valueflo.ws/concepts/resources/#unique-identifiers-for-resources).

## Valueflows Lingo

The UI will need to Query and Mutate the following which is a subset of the [Valueflows vocabulary](https://www.valueflo.ws/specification/uml/).
- Agents
- EconomicEvents
- ResourceSpecifications
- EconomicResources
- Commitment
- Intent
- Satisfaction
- Fullfillment
- Process
- Plan

## Environment Setup

1. Install the holochain dev environment (only nix-shell is required): https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/
2. Enable Holochain cachix with:

```bash
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
cachix use holochain-ci
```

3. Clone this repo and `cd` inside of it.
4. Enter the nix shell by running this in the root folder of the repository: 

```bash
nix-shell
npm install
```

This will install all the needed dependencies in your local environment, including `holochain`, `hc` and `npm`.

Run all the other instructions in this README from inside this nix-shell, otherwise **they won't work**.

## Bootstrapping a network

Create a whole network of nodes connected to each other and their respective UIs with.

```bash
npm run network 3
```

Substitute the "3" for the number of nodes that you want to bootstrap in your network.

This will also bring up the Holochain Playground for advanced introspection of the conductors.

## Running an agent
 
If you only want to run a single conductor and a UI connected to it:

```bash
npm start
```

To run another agent, open another terminal, and execute again:

```bash
npm start
```

Each new agent that you create this way will get assigned its own port and get connected to the other agents.

## Running the DNA tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Building the DNA

```bash
npm run build:happ
```

## Package

To package the web happ:

``` bash
npm run package
```

You'll have the `rea-playspace.webhapp` in `workdir`. This is what you should distribute so that the Holochain Launcher can install it.

You will also have its subcomponent `rea-playspace.happ` in the same folder`.

## Documentation

This repository is using this tooling:

- [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces/): npm v7's built-in monorepo capabilities.
- [hc](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/hc): Holochain CLI to easily manage Holochain development instances.
- [@holochain/tryorama](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama): test framework.
- [@holochain/conductor-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/conductor-api): client library to connect to Holochain from the UI.
- [@holochain-playground/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain-playground/cli): introspection tooling to understand what's going on in the Holochain nodes.
