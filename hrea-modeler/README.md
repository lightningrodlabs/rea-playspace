# HreaModeler Module

Small zome to manage the hrea-modeler in your DNA, in RSM.

This module is designed to be included in other DNAs, assuming as little as possible from those. It is packaged as a holochain zome, and an npm package that offers native Web Components that can be used across browsers and frameworks.

> Notice that this zome still stores all hrea-modeler in the DNA in which the zome is included. Integration and bridging with personas & hrea-modeler will be done in the future, maintaining as much as possible the current API.
