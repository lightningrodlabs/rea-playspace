# Backend Docs >> hc_zome_hrea_modelers_types ||10

Use this crate if you want to communicate with the `hc_zome_hrea_modelers` zome from an external source, without defining all its zome functions.

This is useful in external zomes that want to do a `call` to the hrea-modeler zome, or in external clients written in rust.
