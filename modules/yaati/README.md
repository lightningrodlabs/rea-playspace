# Yaati &mdash; A Type-Friendly Tree Store

Yaati is a highly structured tree with lots of goodies on its branches. It is a typed tree where each node can be typed. It doesn't have to be fully typed, but it provides affordances for it.

Yaati is the name of the Cherimoya tree in the Sierra Popoluca (Nuntajɨɨyi) language. If you're not familiar with the tree, it has many branches and it has delicious, highly structured fruit.

Until I write documentation, pleae see the REA-Playspace app for the code that uses it.
